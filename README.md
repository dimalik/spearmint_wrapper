Spearmint Wrappers
==================

These classes provide some extra boilerplate functionality for Jasper Snoek's [Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/Spearmint) which aims tÎ¿ find the best values for hyperparameters in as few runs as possible.

While immensely helpful Spearmint  such as adding constraints, cleaning parameters

### Fix config.json ###

```Python

from utils import MakeExperiment

experiment = MakeExperiment(experiment_name, distributed, main_file)
experiment.addVar('x', "INT", 1, 0, 1)
experiment.addVar('y', "INT", 1, 0, 1)
experiment.save()

```


### Clean parameters ###

Spearmint can pass . Problems with that is


```Python
def cleanParameters(self):
	self.x = self.negexp(self.x)  # 10 ** -x
	self.y = self.xn(self.y, 5)  # 5 * x
```
